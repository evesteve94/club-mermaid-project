        <h2>About club mermaid</h2>
        <img class="poster" src="images/poster.jpg" alt="">
        <h3>Club Mermaid is a Malmö based drag show aiming to showcase drag
            talent and provide a safe and loving space for the LGBTQ+ community.</h3>

            <div class="bread">
                 <div class="text-1">
            <p>Founded by Jonna Blode Hanno in 2022 Club Mermaid wants to provide opportunites for drag artists and work to enhance the development of drag and its artistic range. Each night has a theme with different artists who're allowed to interpret the theme freely. Drag can be anything! Stand up comedy, singing, dancing, performance art, at Club Mermaid we love it all. We want to work closely with our community and provide opportunites for less experienced artists as well as professional. We aim to book a diverse group of talent and are always open to artist submissions.</p>

        <p>We want to have a positive impact on the queer community as well as the world at large and have previously collaborated with Ensamkommandes Förbund, Trans- och Tjejjouren, Tamam, Naturskyddsföreningen and Page28.</p>

        <p>Club Mermaid has its base at Grand Malmö but we have also performed at Blå Båten, Sir Toby's and Malmöfestivalen. We are also available for private bookings. About our performance at Malmöfestivalen.</p>

        <p>Autumn 2022 Jonna was chosen as Ung Arrangör by Riksteatern and received funding for the shows September-December 2022 making it possible for us to have free admission. As of February 2023 we are no longer receiving any funding and must therefore start charging entry to keep the night going but if you are unable to pay you are always welcome to email us and you shall get a free ticket no questions asked. It is very important to Club Mermaid to be an including and open space for everyone regardless of financial income.</p>

        <p>We don't receive any financial funding however we extend our thanks to the following companies for sponsoring us in other ways ❣️</p>

        <p>We are also available for other events; previously we've had workshops at Garaget Malmö for Youth Pride, Sex för Alla RFSU Cafékväll, Malmö Kulturskola as well as private bookings such as bachelorettes. Send us an email if you're interested in booking Club Mermaid!</p>
